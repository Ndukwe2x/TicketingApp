## Test Data

The following files
 
 1. accounts.json
 2. events.json
 3. ticketsales.json

represent the data structure to be returned by the api controllers from the backend via
a get request. Attention should be payed to the parent object structure that embeds the data 
collection returned as arrays.
Each data object model will return with it an ObjectId field automatically generated by mongodb
as a unique reference to a document within the dataset collection.  

The frontEnd is meant to manipulate this returned data structure for proper presentation.  

 **Note** <br/>
1. Some values for the the database fields are of enum types. <br/>  
  i. accountType can only be of two values: [owner, user] <br/>  
  ii. role can only be of three values:  [Super, Regular, Basic]  
2. The account schema has been updated with an eventRef field to point to an event or series of events associated with a given account.
